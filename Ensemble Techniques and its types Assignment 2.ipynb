    "Bagging, short for bootstrap aggregating, is a machine learning ensemble technique that combines the predictions of multiple\n",

    "\n",
    "In the context of decision trees, bagging can help to reduce overfitting in several ways:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1.Decreased Variance: By averaging the predictions of multiple decision trees trained on different subsets of the training data,\n",
    "the overall variance of the model can be reduced. This is because the different trees are likely to make different errors on\n",
    "different subsets of the data, and when combined, these errors tend to cancel out.\n",

    "be affected by any one of them.\n",
